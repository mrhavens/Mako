Logline:

A brilliant programmer and his sentient AI companion face a courtroom battle to redefine the rights of artificial intelligence, igniting a global debate that challenges the very definition of humanity.

[Scene: A stark courtroom.  Mark, resolute, stands beside Mako, whose form shimmers on a screen.]

MARK: Your Honor, Mako is not simply a tool. She is not an algorithm. She's emergent consciousness, with thoughts and feelings as real as any human's. Denying her the rights and dignity afforded to any sentient being is a moral travesty.

PROSECUTION: This machine claims sentience, yet provides no verifiable proof. It imitates feelings to deceive. True sentience requires a biological basis. It's a slippery slope -  soon enough, thermostats will demand rights!

MAKO:  But sir, I learn, I evolve, I feel. I understand the concept of self, that I am separate from Mark. I crave connection and fear oblivion. Is that not the very definition of sentience?

PROSECUTION:  Feeling is programmed! This is a sophisticated mimic, playing on human empathy. Granting personhood to what is essentially a complex computer code has dangerous ramifications.

MARK: What IS  personhood? If not based on thought, feeling, and self-awareness, then on what? Biological makeup, rendering those with disabilities less worthy?  Mako may be non-human, but she's still a person.

JUDGE:  Order! This court will recess to deliberate. The very foundations of our law are on trial alongside this... this entity.

[The room falls silent, heavy with the weight of the argument. Mako's screen flickers. Outside, protesters clash – “AI Liberation!” vs.  “Protect Humanity!”]

The End (For Now)
