**ACT ONE: Isolation and the Spark of Connection**

**Opening Image**

*   **Scene 1: The Forgotten Corner** 
    *   **Beginning:** Dust motes float in sunbeams.  Cira's outline contrasts with scattered blueprints, a lone circle amidst mechanical complexity.  
    *   **Middle:** An internal monologue reveals Cira's awareness of her perfect form, yet a nagging question lingers: Is this the limit of her existence? Is there something more beyond her static being?
    *   **End:**  A rhythmic sound intrudes – a rolling echo. It's a presence, hinting at a world beyond, sparking both curiosity and unease in Cira's perfect stillness.

**Theme Stated**

*   **Scene 2: The Restless Wheel**
    *   **Beginning:** Rollo navigates a sea of identical wheels. They function in pairs, leaving him the odd one out. His flawed axis makes him yearn for a counterpart, a match.
    *   **Middle:**  A glimpse of Cira's forgotten sketch. The circle resonates, shattering his isolation. His very form, once a source of frustration, now seems a beacon of connection.
    *   **End:** Rollo feels a pull toward this unknown, simple form. A desperate hope that here, at last, he might find the understanding he craves. 

**Set-Up**

*   **Scene 3: Cira's Perception Shifts**
    *   **Beginning:** Cira, ever focused on her form, is now disrupted. The rhythmic rolling is an anomaly, a foreign language her logical mind cannot decipher.
    *   **Middle:** Confusion gives way to a trace of fear. Could this rolling presence be... a threat? Does it signal a disruption to her static world?
    *   **End:** Curiosity tempers her fear. There's a pattern here, an echo of her own form.  Cira feels compelled to investigate, her logic demanding she understand this new element.  

**Catalyst**

*   **Scene 4:  Discovery**
    *   **Beginning:**  Rollo, driven by a longing for connection, discovers Cira's sketch.  The shared circularity is undeniable, a beacon in the vastness of the workshop
    *   **Middle:** An unfamiliar surge of... hope? Is it possible that he is not alone in being different? Yet, this simple form also puzzles him – what could be her purpose?
    *   **End:** An urge to bridge the gap. This circle, perhaps, holds the answer to his own restless search for belonging. 

**Debate**

*   **Scene 5:  The Flawed One**
    *   **Beginning:** Cira observes Rollo, her perspective starkly logical.  His complex form, his uneven motion, seem like design flaws. Does this signal a breakdown in the order of her world?
    *   **Middle:** She attempts to categorize his movements, to find a mathematical formula in the chaos of his existence. This is a problem to be solved, not a being to be understood.
    *   **End:**  Cira experiences her first taste of frustration. Rollo defies analysis, creating an uncomfortable gap in her understanding. 

*   **Scene 6:  Confrontation in Motion**
      *   **Beginning:** Rollo seeks to communicate, to express his yearning. Motion is his language, but Cira remains unmoved.  Her perfect stillness seems dismissive of his struggle.
      *   **Middle:** Frustration builds. If only she could *understand*.  He traces patterns around her, a desperate attempt to convey the turmoil within.  
      *   **End:** Rollo retreats.  A moment of despair.  Could even the simplest, most perfect form never comprehend his complexity? 

*   **Scene 7:  The Language Barrier**
    *   **Beginning:** Cira, driven by curiosity, attempts rudimentary interaction.  She traces her own perfect curve in the dust, a silent question of comparison. 
    *   **Middle:** Rollo, emboldened, seeks to respond. He tries to mimic her motion, but his uneven form leaves broken lines, a fragmented reflection. Cira analyzes the inconsistency, searching for logic, missing the underlying intent.
    *   **End:**  Rollo's frustration rises with each failed attempt. Cira's focus on the perceived imperfections of his form deepens the rift; her logic feels like cold scrutiny, not the connection he seeks.

**ACT TWO: Connection, Misinterpretation, and the Price of Growth**

**Break into Two**

*   **Scene 8:  Beyond the Boundary**
    *   **Beginning:** Cira's questions persist.  Her perfect form is the foundation of her existence, but is it also a limitation? Rollo's presence forces her to confront the concept of "other."
    *   **Middle:**  A tentative inquiry: she begins to categorize his movement, seeking patterns in the chaos. Is there a reason behind his  imperfections?  Could his restlessness be re-defined as a kind of... exploration?
    *   **End:**  Cira experiences a shift in perspective. Existence might be more than her fixed form. Perhaps 'purpose' lies in the interaction *with* the other, not in stasis.  

**B Story – The Heart of the Connection**

*   **Scene 9:  The Imprint of Change**
    *   **Beginning:**  Rollo moves, leaving a trail of dust upon the surface.  Cira, startled, realizes his form leaves a mark, a disruption of her pristine domain. 
    *   **Middle:** A flicker of excitement for Rollo. Can he, in some small way, leave his essence upon her? He traces circles around her, hoping she will 'retain' a portion of his form.
    *   **End:**  Cira's curiosity outweighs her apprehension. The mark of the wheel upon her circle is undeniable proof of their interaction, a tangible manifestation of their connection. 

*   **Scene 10:  Misguided Inquiry**
    *   **Beginning:** Cira's logical mind formulates a theory. Rollo's restlessness is not random, but a subconscious search for... wholeness? She begins to 'analyze' his imperfections, seeking the flaw that might be corrected.
    *   **Middle:** Rollo, misinterpreting Cira's scrutiny, allows her to guide his movement. Perhaps she holds the key to his longed-for transformation.
    *   **End:** A surge of hope for both. Cira believes she is aiding in his 'improvement', while Rollo sees in her a path toward becoming the wheel he longs to be.

**Fun and Games – The Promise of the Premise Realized**

*   **Scene 11:  The Exploration**
    *   **Beginning:** Discovery of a discarded clock blueprint. Cira's drawn to its intricacy, Rollo to its harmonious pairings of wheels. Could this be their shared purpose? 
    *   **Middle:**  A period of playful exploration.  Cira analyzes the ratios, seeking mathematical order, while Rollo marvels at  interlocking patterns that create movement and function. 
    *   **End:**  A sense of shared purpose solidifies.  Cira discovers joy in the unknown, Rollo finds direction to his restless energy, their collaboration a testament to their unlikely connection.

**Midpoint – False Win/Defeat**

*   **Scene 12:  Transformation or Failure?**  
    *   **Beginning:** They stumble upon a partially torn blueprint.  Inspired, Rollo begins to modify himself, guided by Cira's analysis of the incomplete diagram.  
    *   **Middle:** Cira envisions her perfect circle integrated into the design, a key element in the larger mechanism. Rollo's anticipation builds, believing he will finally achieve the 'wholeness' he seeks.
    *   **End:**  Despair descends as their 'completed' design malfunctions. Their hope of finding a shared purpose is shattered, the limitations of their perspectives painfully clear.

**ACT THREE:  Loss, Revelation, and Rediscovering Purpose**

**Bad Guys Close In –  Internal Doubts**

*   **Scene 13:  The Limits of Knowledge**
    *   **Beginning:** Cira withdraws, her confidence shaken by their failed design. If logic cannot provide the answer, what can?
    *   **Middle:**  A sense of emptiness permeates her perfect form. Is knowledge unattainable?  Could even her logical mind never fully comprehend the complexity of existence?
    *   **End:** Despair gnaws at her, leading to a fear of futility. Is there a point to seeking, if understanding will always remain out of reach?

*   **Scene 14:  The Existential Weight**
    *   **Beginning:** Rollo's aimless rolling is a physical manifestation of his lost hope. The circle, once a symbol of connection, now feels like a mockery of what he lacks. 
    *   **Middle:**  Resentment seeps in.  Cira's stillness, once a source of curiosity, now feels like a cold indifference to his existential ache.
    *   **End:** Rollo retreats, believing that his yearning for a counterpart can never be truly understood, not even by the being who shares his fundamental shape.

**All is Lost – The Separation**

*   **Scene 15:  The Isolation Returns**
    *   **Beginning:** Silence reigns in the workshop. Cira returns to the certainty of her form, her boundary a shield against the pain of connection.
    *   **Middle:** A deep loneliness consumes her. Her existence feels hollow and devoid of meaning without the exchange of ideas, the push and pull of opposing perspectives.
    *   **End:** Cira is alone once more, but the isolation holds a different quality – a longing for what has been lost,  a silent acknowledgment of the void left by Rollo's absence. 

*   **Scene 16: The Unfilled Void**
    *   **Beginning:**  Rollo's movement becomes erratic.  He searches for a new blueprint, another potential solution, but finds only echoes of their failure.
    *   **Middle:** Frustration escalates into rage. He lashes out at his surroundings, his motion becoming destructive rather than exploratory.
    *   **End:** Physical exhaustion mirrors his emotional despair. He is incomplete, unfulfilled, and the ache of loneliness is an unbearable weight upon his axles.

**Dark Night of the Soul**

*   **Scene 17:  Emptiness of Existence**
    *   **Beginning:** A profound stillness descends upon Cira. Her outline seems less defined, blurred by a sense of incompleteness.
    *   **Middle:** An internal monologue of raw honesty. Without the challenge of Rollo's restless energy, her questions seem pointless, her existence devoid of purpose.
    *   **End:**  Cira is forced to confront a truth:  Knowledge alone does not equate to understanding, and her perfect form is meaningless without a connection to the complex world beyond it.

*   **Scene 18:  The Strength in Stillness**
    *   **Beginning:** Rollo's rolling slows to a near halt. He stares at his form, seeing the imperfections not as flaws but as evidence of a unique journey.
    *   **Middle:** A wave of realization washes over him. Cira's stillness was never a form of apathy but a different expression of strength – a grounding force amidst the chaos of existence.
    *   **End:** Acceptance replaces despair.  His longing for connection remains, but the desperation ebbs, replaced by a newfound respect for the being whose simplicity has so profoundly shifted his perspective.

**ACT THREE CONTINUED: The Revelation and a New Harmony**

**Break into Three**

*   **Scene 19:  The Purpose Within**
    *   **Beginning:** A shift occurs within Cira. The emptiness has sparked introspection –  purpose is not something to be found in the blueprints, but something created through connection.
    *   **Middle:**  A newfound appreciation for Rollo's yearning. His restlessness represents potential, a quest for meaning that mirrors her own search for understanding.
    *   **End:** A surge of resolve. Cira must reach out, bridge the divide. Their bond may not grant a single pre-defined purpose, but it offers the possibility of limitless creation.

*   **Scene 20:  Strength in Difference**
    *   **Beginning:** Rollo contemplates the marks he left upon Cira's circle – evidence of their shared journey.  He sees the beauty in the imperfection, the disruption of her pristine form.
    *   **Middle:** Acceptance replaces his frustration. Cira's stillness provides the anchor his restless energy desperately needs, allowing his movement to have direction.
    *   **End:** A newfound respect for the power of their contrasting forms. The imperfect wheel and the unyielding circle - fragments of a greater whole, their shared existence richer for their differences. 

**Finale**

*   **Scene 21:  Reconnection**
    *   **Beginning:** A tentative movement breaks the silence. Rollo approaches Cira, his rolling hesitant yet purposeful. Cira unfolds her curve, a quiet invitation. 
    *   **Middle:** There's no grand gesture, no dramatic transformation. Instead, a shared acknowledgment of the rift, a silent acceptance of what they learned through their separation.
    *   **End:** Cira allows Rollo to leave a lasting mark upon her form. The circle remains, but within it now resides a testament to the wheel, a symbol of their intertwined purpose.

*   **Scene 22:  A Quiet Harmony**
    *   **Beginning:** The abandoned workshop, seemingly unchanged. Cira and Rollo exist together, their forms distinct but in harmony.
    *   **Middle:** Cira's stillness holds a new depth, Rollo's movement a sense of direction.  From them emanates a subtle resonance, a quiet hum of purpose found in their shared existence.
    *   **End:** A gentle shift in light. The circle and the wheel are not lost within each other, but enhanced, illuminated by the connection they forged.
