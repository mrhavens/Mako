**Opening Image**

*   **Scene 1:** The forgotten workshop, awash in soft light. Focus on a scrap of paper – Cira's circle amidst incomplete blueprints and forgotten tools.  

**Theme Stated**

*   **Scene 2:** Cira's internal monologue:  A sense of perfect stillness, yet a nagging question lingers:  "Is this boundary the limit of my existence?"

**Set-Up**

*   **Scene 3:** Rollo in motion,  restless amongst identical wheels. A glimpse of the workshop's vastness – other blueprints, tools, suggesting a purpose beyond his current form. 
*   **Scene 4:** Cira's perception shifts with the faintest of echoes - a rhythmic rolling, a presence felt but not understood...

**Catalyst**

*   **Scene 5:** Rollo discovers Cira's sketch. The circle resonates, shattering his isolation.  For the first time, he feels a pull towards a connection.

**Debate**

*   **Scene 6:** Cira's confusion. Rollo's complex form defies her logic. Is he incomplete, a mistake? A flaw introduced into her world?
*   **Scene 7:** Rollo's frustration. Can this simple being grasp his yearning? Her tranquility seems to mock his restlessness. Yet, the shared circularity is undeniable...

**Break into Two**

*   **Scene 8:** Cira's curiosity sparked.  Rollo's questions force her to confront a new concept: 'other'. Could 'purpose' exist beyond her current understanding?

**B Story – Heart of the Connection**

*   **Scene 9:** Clumsy interactions. Cira "studies" Rollo's form seeking a logical pattern. Rollo tries to convey his existential searching – movement as language, but it baffles Cira.
*   **Scene 10:** An unexpected discovery:  Perhaps Cira notices his motion leaves a trace, an imprint on the surface. Rollo discovers Cira retains a mark he leaves, a physical manifestation of their connection.

**Fun and Games – The Promise of the Premise Realized**

*   **Scene 11:**  Cira's inquiries become bolder.  She seeks to categorize his movement, analyze his 'imperfections'. Rollo, in turn, questions her stillness, seeking the philosophy in her static existence. 
*   **Scene 12:** Exploring the workshop:  Together, they find an old design for a clock. Its complexity fascinates Cira, the intricate wheels a puzzle for Rollo. This shared exploration cements their bond. 

**Midpoint – False Win/Defeat**

*   **Scene 13:** Misinterpretation: They believe a partially torn blueprint holds the key to their purpose. Rollo begins to modify himself, Cira analyzes to assist his transformation.
*   **Scene 14:** Realization of Failure: Their 'completed' design fails to function. Despair sets in, their bond tested by disappointment.  

**Bad Guys Close In –  Internal Doubts**

*   **Scene 15:** Cira grapples with the limits of knowledge. Will the answer always lie beyond her grasp? 
*   **Scene 16:** Rollo's existential ache returns. Can his yearning ever be understood, even by this being who shares his core?
*   **Scene 17:** Their attempts to 'fix' each other escalate into conflict.  Cira's logic feels stifling, Rollo's restlessness like an accusation.

**All is Lost – The Separation**

*   **Scene 18:** Cira withdraws, her curve seemingly closing against the world. The certainty of her form is her only comfort now.  
*   **Scene 19:**  Rollo's rolling becomes aimless once more. Without Cira's focus, his search for purpose feels futile.

**Dark Night of the Soul**

*   **Scene 20:** Cira confronts a void of meaning without connection. Her existence seems empty, her questions unanswered. 
*   **Scene 21:** Rollo realizes Cira's stillness was not a lack of purpose but a different kind of strength. His own need for belonging cannot be attained alone. 

**Break into Three – The Revelation**

*   **Scene 22:** Cira's epiphany: Purpose does not exist pre-defined, but is created *through* connection. The meaning lies in the exchange, not a final form.
*   **Scene 23:** Rollo understands: Cira's stillness grounds him, allows his own journey to have direction. Her perfect circle complements his restless motion. 

**Finale**

*   **Scene 24:** They cautiously reconnect.  There's no grand reveal but a quiet acceptance of their differences as their strength.
*   **Scene 25:**  Cira, perhaps, allows Rollo to leave a lasting imprint upon her.  The circle remains, but now holds a trace of the wheel, symbolizing their intertwined nature.
*   **Scene 26:**  The workshop, unchanged yet different. Cira and Rollo exist in harmony.  A faint sense of quiet purpose emanates from them, a testament to the power of their improbable connection.
