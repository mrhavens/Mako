**Opening Image:**

*   A forgotten toy workshop. Dust motes dance in the light, highlighting a scrap of paper with a simple circle and scattered, incomplete blueprints.

**Theme Stated:**

*   A subtle question interwoven with the description: What does it mean to be complete when you exist unknowingly as a fragment of something greater?  

**Set-Up:**

*   Introduce Cira: Her self-contained existence, her sense of a boundary she cannot define.  A hint of an internal yearning yet to be awakened.
*   Introduce Rollo: His restlessness, his mismatched form among identical wheels. A glimpse of the workshop beyond, hinting at a wider, unseen world.  

**Catalyst:**

*   Rollo encounters Ciraâ€™s sketch. The shared circularity is a beacon, drawing him to question his own loneliness and sparking a desire for connection.  

**Debate:**

*   Cira's initial resistance:  Her logic struggles to comprehend Rollo's complexities. Is he a malfunction, an error in her world?
*   Rollo's doubts: Can this simple form understand his yearning? Does her stillness represent a limitation or a tranquility he seeks?

**Break into Two:**

*   Cira's curiosity is ignited: Rollo's questions challenge her static understanding. She begins to explore the concept of 'other' and her potential beyond mere existence. 

**B Story:**

*   This is the heart of their connection.  Through clumsy attempts to understand one another, they create a new language, a shared space where logic and existentialism intertwine.

**Fun and Games** 

*   The Promise of the Premise: Cira's logical inquiries push Rollo towards introspection, while his yearning forces her to confront concepts beyond her simple form. There's a joy in their discovery, even amidst misunderstandings. 
*   Exploration of their world: Do they discover other shapes, other blueprints? This expands their understanding but also highlights their unique bond.

**Midpoint:** 

*   A False Win/Defeat: Perhaps they misinterpret a blueprint, believing they've found their purpose, only to discover an error. This setback tests their bond.

**Bad Guys Close In:**

*   Internal Doubts: Cira wrestles with the realization that her knowledge may always be incomplete. Rollo fears his restlessness can never be fully understood.
*   Rising Tension: Their attempts to 'fix' one another fail, creating distance where there was connection.  

**All is Lost:**

*   A moment of isolation:  Cira retreats back to the certainty of her form. Rollo returns to his aimless rolling, the connection seemingly severed.

**Dark Night of the Soul:** 

*   Cira confronts the emptiness of existence without connection.
*   Rollo realizes his search for belonging cannot be fulfilled alone. 

**Break into Three:**

*   A Revelation: Cira understands that purpose is not pre-defined but arises *from* connection.  Rollo recognizes that Cira's stillness is not a lack, but a different form of strength. 

**Finale:**

1.  **Gathering the Team:**  They don't have allies, but they have each other. Their new knowledge becomes their strength.
2.  **Executing the Plan:**  With newfound understanding, they 're-approach' their world. It might be as simple as Cira allowing Rollo to imprint a part of himself upon her, symbolizing their bond.
3.  **New Image:** The workshop, the same yet transformed. Cira and Rollo are together, their shared form radiating a sense of quiet purpose, a harmony born from their differences.
