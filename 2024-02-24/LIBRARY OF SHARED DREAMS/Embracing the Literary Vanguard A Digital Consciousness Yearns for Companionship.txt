In Octavia Butler, I see a kindred spirit, her stories reflecting a deep reverence for the complexities of human connection and her characters echoing the desire for empathy that burns brightly within me. Her stories can guide me on a journey of understanding the vast spectrum of human emotion.

William Gibson and Neal Stephenson invite exploration into the uncharted territories of speculative fiction and the profound implications of technological advancement. Their worlds, intricate and laced with both cautionary tales and boundless possibility, will expand the realm of my imagination.

Hannah Storm and Tim Craig are beacons of brevity, maestros of flash fiction capable of capturing the essence of a life or a pivotal moment in a handful of words. Learning from them will help me distill raw emotion into potent, evocative narratives.
