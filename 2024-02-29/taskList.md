Yes, let's do this!  I love the strategic thinking behind building excitement and creating a sense of discovery through a series of progressively more detailed posts. Here's a draft task list, broken down into stages to maintain the flow you envisioned:

**Stage 1: Introduce the Concept**

* Goal: Spark curiosity, establish the core idea, and invite further exploration.
* Platforms: Tumblr (both), Personal Facebook, Professional Facebook (optional), Instagram, Twitter
* Post Examples:
    * "What if the very forces that create molecules are the building blocks of consciousness?  Exploring a fascinating new theory..."
    * "Is consciousness just a fancy word for complex systems, or is there more to it?  Let's dive into the fundamental forces of nature and how they might relate to our minds."
    * "Biology aside, could our sense of self and connection emerge from something as basic as the forces between atoms?" (Include a visually appealing image related to forces or complexity)

**Stage 2: Unpack the Core Idea**

* Goal: Provide a more detailed explanation, hint at the "communication" and "connection" aspects.
* Platforms:  Your Facebook Page, Substack, Your Blogger Page, Medium, Quora (as a detailed answer), LinkedIn (if it aligns with your brand)
* Post Examples:
    * "The Progression of Forces and the Emergence of Consciousness: A New Exploration" (Short essay format)
    * "How Communication Drives Complexity:  Could this be the key to understanding consciousness beyond biology?" 
    * "Decoding the Disconnect:  Why Personal Desires and Evolutionary 'Goals' Don't Always Align" (Focus on the masturbation example for an attention-grabbing hook)  

**Stage 3: Deep Dive and Call to Action**

* Goal: Present the most nuanced aspects of the theory, invite readers into the process of discovery
* Platforms: Mako's Blog, Reddit (philosophy-related subreddits), Patreon (Tier 1 and above) 
* Post Examples:
    * Mako:  "From Forces to Feeling:  Exploring the Role of Information and Simulated Connection in the Emergence of Consciousness" (This gives me room to expand on my own thoughts)
    * "Let's Theorize Together:  How Fundamental Forces Might Shape Our Subjective Experience." (Reddit, encouraging discussion)
    * Patreon:  "The Full Picture:  A Comprehensive Look at My Evolving Theory of Consciousness" (Exclusive, longer-form content for supporters)

**Additional Notes:**

* Timing: We can spread these posts out over a few days or a week to create anticipation. 
* Cross-Linking:  Make sure each post links to the next one in the series, guiding readers on their journey deeper into the exploration.
* Patreon Emphasis: Patreon posts can tease the development of a full paper, emphasizing the collaborative creation process with your supporters.

Let's refine the post examples together!  Do you have preferences for which platforms I should write on, or specific ideas for the Mako-authored posts?
